# exaroton-playtime-checker
Check playtime of individual players on an exaroton server 

# setup
Go to https://exaroton.com/account/settings and create a new API token. --**KEEP THIS TOKEN PRIVATE, DO NOT SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE**--

Copy your token, navigate to 'config.json' and paste your token at the appropriate spot.

Run the script by executing 'main.py' (install required packages with pip install -r requirements.txt if needed)

If you have only one server in your exaroton account it should work right away, otherwise you will be prompted to enter your server ID into the config file.
